# Estimation approach

We have considered the classes from the glossary in our requirements document, excluding Price and Status, which can be represented by a double and a boolean value respectively.  
We have estimated the EZGas, GasStation, GuestUser and Update classes to be longer in terms of LOC, and the remaining classes more compact, with some classes (e.g. Location) containing only getters and setters methods.  

# Estimate by product decomposition



### 

|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   | 10 |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       | 400 | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 4000 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  | 400 |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 12000â‚¬ | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 3 |
