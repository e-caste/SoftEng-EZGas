Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things
    We got to work with Spring Boot, an ubiquitous framework, which let us code the Ezgas app with little training.
    Having to work remotely turned up to be fun and taught us how important is to divide the tasks among teammates.
    Version control was crucial to this project; we appreciated that the chosen system was Git and working to the Ezgas forced us to familiarize with it.
    CATME Team-Maker let us work with colleagues we did not know: our group cooperated efficiently, our working hours coincided and there were no conflicts.
# Worst things
    Slack platform was confusionary, information which could be useful to all groups were difficult to find, questions were often forgotten or not answered in time with respect to the deadlines.
    Issues found early in the project were taken into consideration too late, for the last deadline, well past the start of the exam session.
# Suggestions 
    An introduction to the Spring Boot framework would have been appreciated.
    Slack could be used more efficiently creating a single channel and maybe scheduling a fixed time when questions are answered.
