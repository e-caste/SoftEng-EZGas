Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things
We got to work with Spring Boot, an ubiquitous framework, which let us code the EZGas app with little training.  
Having to work remotely turned out to be fun and taught us how important it is to divide the tasks among teammates.  
Version control was crucial to this project; we appreciated that the chosen tool was Git and working to EZGas helped us to familiarize with it.  
CATME Team-Maker let us work with colleagues we did not know: our group cooperated efficiently, our working hours coincided and there were no conflicts.  

# Worst things
The choice of Slack was good, but it was used in a confusing way, and information which could be useful to all groups was difficult to find, questions were often forgotten or not answered in time with respect to the deadlines.  
Some EZGas issues that were found early were taken into consideration too late, for the last deadline, well past the beginning of the exam session.  

# Suggestions 
A longer introduction to the Spring Boot framework would have been nicely appreciated.  
Slack could have been used more efficiently creating two channels, one for announcements and one for discussion.
