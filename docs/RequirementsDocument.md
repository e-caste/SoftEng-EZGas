# Stories and personas

Tom Honks is a truck driver always on the move. His company pays for gas, but he would like to start off on the right foot with the new boss. He is determined to find a way to reduce company costs to make a good impression and hopefully get a promotion to an office job, so he can stay more regularly at home with his family.
He finally finds the solution to his problem: EZGas, a crowd-sourced application that allows all the truck drivers in his company to determine at which gas station to stop.

Antonio is a man who has moved from Puglia to Piemonte for a job. Everytime he has to go on holiday to Puglia, he travels with his car. Moreover the car runs on natural gas, so it is really difficult to find a gas station suitable for his car. As the trip is really long, he would like to know where the gas stations are and where the prices are convenient, in order to save money. EZGas would be perfect for him, because, according to where he is, he could find the nearest gas station with the best prices.

Jared, 18 years old, just had his car bought as a present from his parents. He goes to high school, doesn't study a lot and his professors report that he doesn't behave well towards his classmates. Jared recently got to know about EZgas from one of his classmates and decided to download it to mess up the system by uploading wrong data. The developers of EZGas have thought about this chance, so Jared is left without the satisfaction of messing up the database.

|  Precondition  | User U has installed EZGas app, Maps M are available on the Internet, Location L exists |  
|  Post condition | Location searched is displayed on U's screen |
|  Nominal Scenario | U searches for L and L is displayed on M |
|  Variants | Maps not available, issue error |
| | Internet connection not available, issue warning |
| | Location does not exist, issue warning |

| Actors Involved        | User, Maps |
| ------------- |-------------| 
|  Precondition  | User U has installed EZGas app, Maps M are available on the Internet, User Location UL exists |  
|  Post condition | The nearest gas stations to UL are displayed on U's screen |
|  Nominal Scenario | U searches for nearest gas stations |

| | Internet connection not available, issue warning |

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR2.2 Filter search based on lowest price

|  Precondition  | User U has installed EZGas app, Maps M are available on the Internet, User Location UL exists |  
|  Post condition | The gas stations with the lowest price in a default or user-selected range are displayed on U's screen |
