# Timesheet Change Requests

Report in this table the effort (in person hours) spent per week, per activity, per team. 
This means that you have to sum the working hours of each component of the team.

Activity CR0 refers to all effort (design, coding, testing) relative to CR0, or changing the project to pass Acceptance tests provided by the teachers.
Activity CR4 and CR7 similarly refer to design, coding, testing for CR4 and CR7.

Activity Other refers to effort to produce other documents (such as Project risks, project post mortem etc)


These figures will not be used to evaluate neither the project nor the team
